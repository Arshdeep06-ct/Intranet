# Intranet Planning and Implementation for Andrew (Webmaster)


## Intranet for Company Use – Technical Overview

An intranet is an internal network designed to provide employees with access to company resources, internal communication tools, and collaborative spaces. For a company webmaster like Andrew, building and managing an intranet requires careful planning and the right technical tools. Here's a detailed guide to help in the planning and implementation of an intranet.

### Key Considerations for Implementation:

1. **Infrastructure and Hosting**:
   - **Self-hosted or Cloud-based?** Decide whether to host the intranet on your company servers or on a cloud service. Self-hosting gives more control but requires more resources for maintenance. Cloud hosting can reduce overhead and improve scalability.
   - **Network Security:** Ensure secure access controls to prevent unauthorized access. This may include VPNs, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and IP restrictions for internal-only use.

2. **Platform Choice**:
   - Choose a content management system (CMS) or intranet software solution that aligns with your company’s needs. Some popular intranet platforms include SharePoint, Confluence, and Jive.
   - Custom-built solutions are also an option, but they require significant time and technical expertise.

3. **User Access and Permissions**:
   - Define user roles: Not all employees need access to the same information. Create different permission levels (admin, editor, viewer) to control who can access and edit the content.
   - Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) for ease of access across platforms, reducing login fatigue for users.

4. **Content and Document Management**:
   - A robust document management system (DMS) is essential for storing, sharing, and collaborating on files. Consider integrating tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.
   - Organize content in a clear structure (e.g., categories like HR, IT, Policies) to ensure easy navigation.

5. **Search Functionality**:
   - A strong search feature is critical. Users should be able to find documents, policies, or other resources quickly.
   - Make sure your intranet platform supports full-text search and filters to refine results by content type, date, or department.

6. **Collaboration Tools**:
   - Include tools for team collaboration, such as internal messaging, discussion boards, and project management tools.
   - Ensure that features like real-time editing, commenting, and version control are included to improve teamwork.

7. **Customization and Branding**:
   - The intranet should reflect the company's branding (logos, colors, fonts). Customization options within your chosen platform should allow for this, while also maintaining user-friendliness.

8. **Maintenance and Updates**:
   - Regularly update the intranet’s content, software, and security protocols. A schedule for maintenance should be established, and backups should be regularly performed.
   - Monitor user activity to assess the effectiveness of the intranet and identify areas for improvement.

### Planning and Design Process:

1. **Needs Assessment:** 
   Conduct interviews with key stakeholders (HR, IT, Marketing, etc.) to determine the essential features and functionality.
   
2. **Design:** 
   Create wireframes or prototypes to visualize the layout, navigation, and user interface.
   
3. **Development:** 
   Build the intranet using the selected platform. Integrate necessary systems (document management, email, calendar, etc.).
   
4. **Testing:** 
   Perform extensive testing to ensure all features work as expected, especially for security and user permissions.
   
5. **Launch and Training:** 
   Roll out the intranet in phases, providing employees with training to ensure adoption. Collect feedback and make any necessary adjustments.
